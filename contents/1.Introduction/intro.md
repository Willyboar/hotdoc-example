## Welcome to Hotdoc

Hotdoc is a single page documentation generator build with Nim, Karax & Markdown. The basic idea was to create a tool who builds quick documentations base on a specific folder structure that can be hosted in a github repo(like this one) and people can contribute by adding markdown files .
